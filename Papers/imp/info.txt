1) Beware, Your Hands Reveal Your Secrets!

Authors : Diksha Shukla, Rajesh Kumar, Abdul Serwadda, Vir V. Phoha

Published In : CCS '14 Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security, 2014

Objective : Research on attacks which exploits video-based side-channels to decode text typed on a smartphone.

Methodology :  Used HTC One phone as victim's device. Used Google Nexus 5 camera to record PIN entry process. 

Achievement : 50% of the PIN's on first attempt and on average of over 85% of PINs in ten attempts.

Research gap : Work can be extended to detect android pattern based locks.

2) Input extraction via motion-sensor behavior analysis on smartphones

Authors : ChaoShen, Shichao Pei, Zhenyu Yanga, Xiaohong Guan

2015

Objective : To infer user input using accelerometer and magnetometer sensors.

Methodology :   three different types of smartphones, each operating on Android 4.1.x. The smartphones are Samsung Galaxy, Huawei Ascend P6, ZTE V800.
		Thus we used the accelerometer data in all three axes and the orientation data in two axes as a source to 
		represent the posture change of a smartphone.

Achievement : The results indicated that users’ inputs can be accurately inferred from the sensor data, with the accuracies of 100% for input-action detection and 80% 			for input inference in some cases.

Research gap : This work could be extended to infer other kind of text example email, chatting messages.

4) When Good Becomes Evil: Keystroke Inference with Smartwatch 

Authors: Xiangyu Liu, Zhe Zhou, Wenrui Diao, Zhou Li, Kehuan Zhang

Published In :
ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security

2015

Objective : To investigate security issues that can be generated from smart watch sensors especially using accelerometer and microphone.

Methodology :  LG G WATCH was used as a smart watch. Used microphone to identify the window of individual keystrokes.

Achievement : For numeric keyboard, the probability of ?nding banking PINs in the top 3 candidates can reach 65%.

Research gap :	 Data from the sensors in touch-screen devices and smart watches can be combined together and produce more entropy,such that thea ccuracy can be further improved.

5) MoLe: Motion Leaks through Smartwatch Sensors

Authors : He Wang, Ted Tsung-Te Lai, Romit Roy Choudhury

Published In :
MobiCom '15 Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking

2015

Objective : To mine accelerometer and gyroscope data from smart watches to infer what user is typing. 

Methodology :  MoLe has been implemented on the Galaxy Gear Live smart watch. The MoLe client on the watch continuously logs accelerometer and gyroscope readings at 200Hz, along with timestamps. 

Achievement : 

Research gap :  MoLe is not yet a real-world attack since it is not able to detect the space bar and separate out words from a sentence and can only detect dictionary 		words.

6) PIN Skimming: Exploiting the Ambient-Light Sensor in Mobile Devices

Authors : Raphael Spreitzer, Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria

Published In : SPSM '14 Proceedings of the 4th ACM Workshop on Security and Privacy in Smartphones & Mobile Devices
2014

Objective :  infer a user’s PIN input based on a set of known PINs using Ambient-Light Sensor.

Methodology :	Used Samsung Galaxy S4 to capture Lux Values Including RGBW Value of ambient light sensor.

Achievement :	Able to determine the correct PIN—out of a set of 50 random PINs—within the ?rst ten guesses about 80% of the time. In contrast, the chance of ?nding 		the right PIN by randomly guessing ten PINs would be 20%. 

Research gap :  It does not work in case the user operates the mobile device in a completely dark environment.
